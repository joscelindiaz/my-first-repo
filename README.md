### Geography

I live with Tony, the cochinito bello, we are currently living on a pandemic and he doesnt want to wash his hands properly.

### Reading

Two of the things make me mad are:

-*Wash hands* by Tony
-*Clean bath* by Tony

### Food

Tony touched the cake on purpose because:

1. He is cochinito
2. He wants to infect me
3. He wants to be singlle again

### Contact

Please keep in mind that he wants to eliminate me [asap](https://twitter.com/joscelin)
